Downstream

I pulled from lab 4 because it has box2d integrated and whatnot.

I'm adding my code to edu/cornell/gdiac/physics/fish 

todo:

Omar - Gameplay Controller

Dash - Fish and Tether Classes/ Gameplay Controller

Ben - Input Controller and GDX Root, loading screen

Teddy - Game Canvas, Desktop Launcher, and enemy fish class
